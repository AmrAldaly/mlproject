#  Heart Failure Survival Prediction — End-to-End ML Project

This project predicts the survival probability of patients with heart failure using clinical records.

The main objective is not only model accuracy, but to demonstrate a complete end-to-end Machine Learning system — from data ingestion and preprocessing to model deployment in the cloud using Docker.

This project follows a production-grade ML system design, not a notebook-based workflow.

##  Project Highlights

Modular ML pipeline using MVC architecture

Advanced preprocessing (Winsorization + RobustScaler + StandardScaler)

Multiple model comparison and hyperparameter tuning

Best model: HistGradientBoostingClassifier

Model & preprocessor serialized with dill

Flask web app for real-time predictions

Docker containerization

Cloud deployment on AWS / Azure

##  Machine Learning Pipeline

The project is structured into independent components:

### Data Ingestion

Reads raw dataset

Performs train/test split

Stores artifacts

### Data Transformation

Winsorization for outlier handling

ColumnTransformer with:

RobustScaler (skewed features)

StandardScaler (normal features)

Preprocessor saved as artifact

### Model Training

Multiple classifiers tested

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Best model selected based on F1 score

Model saved as artifact

### Prediction Pipeline

Loads saved model & preprocessor

Performs inference on new data

##  Web Application

A Flask web interface allows users to input patient clinical data and receive real-time survival prediction.

##  Run with Docker (Local)
docker build -t heart-failure-ml .
docker run -p 8000:8000 heart-failure-ml


Open in browser:

http://localhost:8000

##  Cloud Deployment

The Dockerized application can be deployed to:

AWS ECS + ECR

Azure Container Apps

This ensures portability, scalability, and production-ready deployment.
